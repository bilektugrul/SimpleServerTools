# SimpleServerTools

A well-coded Essentials alternative with many commands and features. SST doesn't contain any non-useful and pointless command. You can edit many features of the plugin as you wish. You can change every message.

## Requirements

SST is designed for every actively used Minecraft version. It supports every Minecraft version from 1.8.8 (PaperSpigot) to 1.16.5 (Paper recommended).  
Some features requires ProtocolLib.  
Vault is required for permissions and group-based features.  
Paper (or any fork of it) is recommended and will work better.  

LuckPerms is a must. I have no experience with other permission plugin and cannot provide support for other plugins.  

Fully tested and compiled with AdoptOpenJDK 16. Versions below 16 is not and will not be supported.

## Wiki

Wiki will be ready soon. You can get basic informations from [Spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/simpleservertools-1-8-8-1-16-5-completely-configurable-all-in-one.92388/).

Go to the source directory and use ``mvn clean package`` for getting the .jar file.   
We recommend IntelliJ IDEA.
